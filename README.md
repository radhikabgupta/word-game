# Word Guess

Create a Word Guess command-line game using constructor functions.

## Guidelines

- The app runs from the command line by entering node index.js

- The app follows the rules that are outlined below on How the Game is Played.

- The program random picks a word and prints a row of low dashes ( _ ), giving the number of letters in the word.

- If the guessing player guesses a letter which occurs in the word, the program displays it in the correct position(s).

- If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the player loses a guess.

- The game is over when - the guessing player completes the word. Or the guessing player has used 5 guesses.

- Console.log messages are color coded to help users.
